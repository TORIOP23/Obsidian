# Libraries
- The [[Transformers library]] library: Provides APIs and easy-to-use functions to utilize transformers or download pre-trained models. The models support tasks from different ML fields like NLP, Computer Vision, Audio, or Multimodal.
- The [`tokenizers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/index) library: Provides optimized tokenizers that are often used together with models from the `transformers` library.
- The [`datasets`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) library: Provides an easy way of accessing and sharing datasets.
- The [`accelerate`](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index) library: Easily run PyTorch training and inference on distributed settings.
- The [`diffusers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index) library: Provides pre-trained vision diffusion models, commonly used for text-to-image tasks.
