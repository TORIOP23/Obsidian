# Neutral Network
- Also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs)
- Neural networks work through a process called **forward propagation**
- Neural networks are trained using a process called [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation). 
- A basic neural network consists of interconnected neurons in three layers:
	- Input layer
	- Hidden layer
	- Output layer
## Type of ANN
### Feedforward neural networks (FNN)
- Simplest variant
- Use in NLP, CS 
### CNNs
- Convolutional neural networks
### DNNs
- Deconvolutional neural networks
### RNNs
- Recurrent neural networks
### [[LSTM]]
- Long short-term memory networks
